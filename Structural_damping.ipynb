    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In structural dynamics, mass and stiffness can be computed directly from the geometric characteristics and material properties of a structure but damping can only be estimated based on the fact that structural dynamic responses are, well, damped. It is usually assumed that structural damping is viscous, in the absence of more accurate information, which fits nicely in the [dynamic equilibrium equation](#Dynamic-equilibrium-equation) classical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This python notebook will explore the following types of viscous damping in the computation of the dynamic responses of multi-degree-of-freedom systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Mass proportional damping](#Mass-proportional-damping)\n",
    "2. [Stiffness proportional damping](#Stiffness-proportional-damping)\n",
    "3. [Rayleigh damping](#Rayleigh-damping)\n",
    "4. [Caughey damping](#Caughey-damping)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using any of these types of damping, the damping matrix is orthogonal to the modal matrix and, therefore, it is diagonalizable. This constitutes a clear advantage when it comes to solving the dynamic equilibrium equation system for multi-degree-of-freedom systems.\n",

    "In structural dynamics the second order differential dynamic equilibrium equation can be written in terms of generalized coordinates (d[isplacement]) and their first (v[elocity]) and second (a[cceleration]) time derivatives:\n",

    "\n",
    "In a multi-degree-of-freedom dynamic system all these matrices are of size $NDOF \\times NDOF$, where $NDOF$ is the number of generalized degrees of freedom. Carrying out the usual coordinate transformation from generalized coordinates to modal coordinates, $\\mathbf{d(t)} = \\mathbf{\\Phi}^T \\times \\mathbf{q(t)}$, and pre-multiplying by the transpose of the modal matrix, $\\mathbf{\\Phi}^T$, one obtains the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "On the contrary, the product $\\mathbf{\\Phi}^T \\times \\mathbf{C} \\times \\mathbf{\\Phi}$ is a diagonal matrix (with modal damping in the main diagonal) only in certain circunstances. This is achieved when damping is \"proportional\" to either mass or stiffness or a combination of both.\n",

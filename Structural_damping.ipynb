    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In structural dynamics, mass and stiffness can be computed directly from the geometric characteristics and material properties of a structure but damping can only be estimated based on the fact that structural dynamic responses are, well, damped. It is usually assumed that structural damping is viscous, in the absence of more accurate information, which fits nicely in the [dynamic equilibrium equation](#Dynamic-equilibrium-equation).\n",
    "\n",
    "This python notebook will explore three types of viscous damping normally considered in the computation of dynamic responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Stiffness proportional damping](#Stiffness-proportional-damping)\n",
    "2. [Mass proportional damping](#Mass-proportional-damping)\n",
    "3. [Rayleigh damping](#Rayleigh-damping)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using this type of damping, the \"damping\" matrix is orthogonal to the modal matrix and, therefore, is diagonalizable. This constitutes a clear advantage when it comes to solving the dynamic equilibrium equation system for multi-degree-of-freedom systems.\n",
